This example demonstrates how a parameter sweep can be generated and executed locally for sacred. In particular: 
    - queue-experiments.py: Generate different parameter sweeps, based on a complete grid search (with repeats) or based on randomized selection
    - run-one-simulation.py: Select one of the generated simulations and run it individually
    - run-all-random.py: Run all experiments of the randomized list
