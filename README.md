Integrated Active Matter Simulations (IAMS)

Goal:
Coordinate all numerical experiments of the Thomson Lab into one framework. In particular, we want to 
    (1) Store all experiments to a common database, which we can easily query. 
    (2) Have a simple framework setup which allows rapidly generating the required files with run instructions.
    (3) Have our codes containerized, for simple embarassingly parallel setup.
